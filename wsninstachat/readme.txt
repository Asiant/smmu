To install, simply upload the contents of this directory to your web server and then visit it in your web browser. If your server runs apache as a different user than your FTP user then you'll also need to CHMOD the chatters subdirectory to 777 -- you'll know you need to do this if you get write errors. To test a conversation, open two web browsers (for example, both Chrome and Firefox) and use a different name in each.

There are a few configurations and language options you can change by editing the config.php file -- not required, it'll work fine unchanged. To integrate the look of the chat into your website, edit the header.tpl and footer.tpl templates.
